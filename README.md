### About

I started in the web side eg. LAMP back in 2013. Now have transitioned mostly to JavaScript eg. ReactJS and Electron/React Native. I use Python sometimes(like working with Raspberry Pi). Currently I work mostly on the web side. For personal projects I'll get as low as working with ADC's to interface with analog sensors but I barely touch that stuff eg. I'm still using Python/some library.

I worked as a PSD-to-template guy for a little over a year before doing my software engineer role currently. So I can build interfaces from designs. I can build accompanying backends as well. I'm trying to find my own projects to turn into SaaS products but I have not found anything yet.

### Work

Currently work with ReactJS with heavy testing eg. Jest/WDIO(Mocha/Selenium visual regression testing).

### Active sensors

This will be a section I update with stats from sensors I have collecting data. My anemometer has I'd say at least 4-5 million records now as it collects data every second(sends it in 1 minute batches). Pretty useless overall but cool project.

I have not personally setup GitHub "actions" before, I think it is possible.
