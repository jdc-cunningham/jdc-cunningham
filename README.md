### About
I'm currently a software engineer in the medical industry. Primarily I work on building user interfaces with ReactJS and Rails. On my own time I'm working on getting more into hardware and robotics/vision. I have a weak academic background so this mostly self-learning.

#### Automated updates
This README is updated by a script I have running on a Raspberry Pi, can see the repo [here](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/raspi-git-repo-updater).
