### About

I started in the web side eg. LAMP back in 2013. Now have transitioned mostly to JavaScript eg. ReactJS/Node/Express and Electron/React Native. I still mostly prefer MySQL/MariaDB over Postgres just for ease of use reasons. I use Python sometimes(like working with Raspberry Pi). Currently I work mostly on the web side. For personal projects I'll get as low as working with ADC's to interface with analog sensors but I barely touch that stuff eg. I'm still using Python/some library.

I worked as a PSD-to-template guy for a little over a year before doing my software engineer role currently. So I can build interfaces from designs. I can build accompanying backends as well. I'm trying to find my own projects to turn into SaaS products but I have not found anything yet.

### Work

Currently work with ReactJS with heavy testing eg. Jest/WDIO(Mocha/Selenium visual regression testing).

### Side note
This repo is updated by a script I have on a Raspberry Pi, can see the repo [here](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/raspi-git-repo-updater) uses NodeJS. It's an MVP.
