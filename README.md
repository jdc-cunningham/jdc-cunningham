### About
I'm currently a software engineer in the medical industry. Primarily I work on building user interfaces with ReactJS and Rails. On my own time I'm working on getting more into hardware and robotics/vision. I have a weak academic background so this mostly self-learning.

### Side note
This repo is updated by a script I have on a Raspberry Pi, can see the repo [here](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/raspi-git-repo-updater) uses NodeJS. It's an MVP. Also if this stops updating might mean I'm homeless. Edit: I'm going to reduce this to 1 commit a day to reduce the "commit count pollution".
